# Call Centre Data Analysis

## Project Overview
This project focuses on analyzing call center performance using an Excel dataset. The dataset was provided in the **Data Sheet**, which contains raw call details, customer information, and satisfaction ratings. A **dashboard** was created using pivot tables and charts to visualize key performance indicators effectively.

## Dataset Breakdown
- **Data Sheet:** The original dataset provided, containing essential call center data, including:
  - Call Number
  - Customer ID
  - Call Duration (in minutes)
  - Representative Handling the Call
  - Date of Call
  - Purchase Amount (in USD)
  - Satisfaction Rating (1-5 scale)
- **Pivots Sheet:** Summarizes key performance metrics such as total calls handled, total duration, average satisfaction rating, and the distribution of 5-star ratings.
- **Call Centre Report Sheet:** Provides structured insights, tables, and visual summaries of call center performance.
- **Dashboard:** Created using pivot tables and charts to visually represent trends and patterns.

## Key Findings
- A total of **1000 calls** were analyzed with varying customer satisfaction ratings and purchase amounts.
- The **average customer satisfaction rating** is **3.88**, indicating a generally positive but improvable service quality.
- Higher satisfaction ratings correlate with **shorter call durations** and **higher purchase amounts**, suggesting efficient and effective service delivery leads to better outcomes.
- The **dashboard highlights trends** such as peak call hours, customer satisfaction distribution, and purchase trends.
- The dataset can be leveraged for **performance tracking, customer behavior analysis, and strategic decision-making** to enhance call center efficiency.

## Tools Utilized
- **Microsoft Excel** for:
  - Data organization and cleaning
  - Pivot table creation for performance metrics
  - Visualization of trends through charts and graphs
  - Dashboard design to present key insights effectively

## Analytical Process
1. **Data Cleaning**: Ensured data integrity by checking for missing, duplicate, or misaligned values and standardizing formats.
2. **Pivot Table Analysis**: Created pivot tables to aggregate and summarize key performance indicators.
3. **Dashboard Development**: Designed a user-friendly dashboard to present critical insights using interactive charts.
4. **Report Compilation**: Structured findings into a report with actionable insights for performance improvement.

## Summary of Results
| Metric                     | Value        |
|----------------------------|-------------|
| Total Calls                | 1000        |
| Average Satisfaction Rating | 3.88        |
| Highest Satisfaction Rating | 5.0         |
| Lowest Satisfaction Rating  | 1.0         |
| Average Call Duration       | 89.85 min   |
| Total Purchase Amount       | $96,623     |

## Areas for Improvement
- **Data Structuring:** Standardize column naming conventions and ensure data consistency for more efficient processing.
- **Enhanced Visualization:** Incorporate interactive slicers and conditional formatting to improve dashboard usability.
- **Deeper Analysis:** Perform trend analysis on call volume fluctuations, representative performance, and customer purchase patterns.
- **Predictive Insights:** Use statistical methods or machine learning techniques to predict customer satisfaction based on call characteristics.
- **Operational Optimization:** Identify high-performing representatives and peak call times to optimize workforce allocation.

This project serves as a foundation for call center analytics, demonstrating how **Excel-based pivot tables and dashboards** can be used to derive meaningful insights from raw data. ðŸš€
